## About Numbers

- **random_maths_quiz**
  - The random math quiz consists of four topics:
   - Addition: This operation is used when you want to find the total, or sum, of two or more amounts.
   - Subtraction: This operation is used when you want to find the difference between two amounts or how much of something you have left after a quantity is used ""–" for example, if you want to find the change owed after spending an amount of money.
   - Division: Division is used when sharing or grouping items. For example, if you want to know how many doughnuts you can buy with £6 if one doughnut costs £1.50, you would do £6 ÷ £1.50.
   - Multiplication : This operation is also used for totals and sums but when there is more than one of the same number "–" for example if you are buying five packs of apples that cost £1.20 each, you would do 5 "×" £1.20.

    By selecting automatic deploys, Heroku will build a new version of the app each time a change has been pushed to the repository
    Manual deploys allow you to build a new version of your app whenever you click manual deploy
    If your build is successful you will then be able to visit the live site by clicking the link that is provided to you by Heroku
